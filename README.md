# GLOBAL-COVID-19-PANDEMIC-ANALYSIS-VISUALIZATION

### COVID-19 Interactive Visualization: Dynamic Choropleth Map & 3D Globe

This project offers an **Interactive dashboard visualizatio** to explore COVID-19 data globally. The tool features **dynamic choropleth maps** and a **3D globe**, enabling users to track and analyze the progression of the pandemic over time.

#### Key Features:

**Interactive Visualizations**:  
  The tool presents **choropleth maps** and **3D globe** views, displaying COVID-19 data across countries. Users can toggle between **cases** or **deaths**, and explore the data for any specific date.

**Time-based Exploration**:  
  A **play/pause** button allows users to simulate the spread of the pandemic over time. The **date slider** enables users to manually select any date, offering a dynamic way to observe the evolution of COVID-19 globally.

**Data Sources**:  
  World Health Organization (WHO) https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data?n=c 
  
**Geographical Insights**:  
  Built with **D3.js** (v7), **TopoJSON**, and **D3-Geo-Projections**, the map uses the **Mercator** or **Orthographic** projection, allowing users to visualize the global spread of the virus from different geographical perspectives.

**User Engagement**:  
  Interactive **tooltips** display detailed information when hovering over a country. A **leaderboard** ranks the top 10 most affected countries, showcasing flags and the number of cases or deaths for each country.

**Responsive Design**:  
  The tool is optimized for both **desktop** and **mobile devices**, ensuring an engaging experience across all screen sizes.

#### Technologies Used:
**D3.js** (v7)
**TopoJSON**
**D3-Geo-Projections**
**HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**
**CSV** and **GeoJSON** data formats

#### Project Purpose:
This project aims to provide an intuitive, interactive platform for understanding the global impact of COVID-19. By combining **data visualization** with **geographical insights**, it helps make complex pandemic data more accessible, engaging, and meaningful for users worldwide.
